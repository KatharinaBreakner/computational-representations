# Reading responses

For each *required* reading, you are expected to write a couple of paragraphs (2-4) about the text that you just read.

At the top of the response, please select **one quote** from the text that you found interesting. It can be a couple of words, a sentence, or several sentences. Come to class ready to discuss why you choose it.

Below, write a more general response, answering some of the following questions:

- what do you think are the main ideas exposed in the text?
- what struck you most about the text?
- what did you agree with? why?
- what did you disagree with? why?
- how does that relate to the way you see computers or visual arts?
